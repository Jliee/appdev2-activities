As an experienced professional in the software industry, you are currently employed at a company that has developed its own software solution, integrating various third-party software components. Recently, your team encountered a significant challenge with one of your third-party software providers. The provider notified you that they would cease support for your current implementation and required you to upgrade your codebase to align with their new implementation standards.

This unexpected development prompted your team to reflect on your processes and consider preventive measures to mitigate similar challenges in the future. While this issue primarily concerns the third-party software provider, it raises questions about your approach to software integration and dependency management.

What initial steps could your team have taken to anticipate potential changes or discontinuation of support from third-party software providers?

Answer:
This event should encourage the team to consider writing a risk management plan that is alligned with the ISO's (International Organization for Standardization) Third-Party Management Requirements and ensure black and white documents to protect both parties from suffering damages on such events.
